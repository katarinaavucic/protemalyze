Description: protemalyze is an R package designed to analyze protein embeddings 
    derived from protein Language Models (pLMs). Protein embeddings are 
    numerical representations of protein sequences that have been shown to 
    capture essential information encoded in the protein. These embeddings are 
    particularly useful for identifying structurally or functionally similar 
    proteins. protemalyze provides an accessible entry point for researchers to 
    explore data from pLMs without having to engage with the technical details 
    of the underlying methods.
